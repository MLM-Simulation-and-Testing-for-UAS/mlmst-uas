Small summary on sprint 1
Team and github repository was created. The applications to be used
where downloadded in to the devices. THis includes linux, julia, gazebo, and ardupilot.
 
Tested that the installed apps work properly. I created a small Julia "Cheatsheet" the type you would use to remember or have examples of how to code basics things in a programmihng language in order to be able to reference it for quicker coding pace.
Julia seems to be a rahter big amalgam of coding languages?, You can cross reference syntax similar to java and c in all the areas.

Started sprint 2 met with the team. Started the Julia installation document.

October 2, 2024     
Finished julia installing file. Most of the information for it is on the julia website making it easy to access the document. I checked out the new UAW-Testing github repository in order to be able to familiarize myself with the files a bit morel. It will take a bit more time in order to fullly dive into it.

A bit of weird news? Sprint 2:
hurricane hit and classes got cancelled from OCtober 8th to the 18th. I lost power at the apartment making it rather difficult to work over the week.

new study problem to investigate: how do you use julia to communicate with ardupilot?

Use ROS to as a middle man for julia and ardupilot.

goals for the day:
1) install ROS in the VM (done)
2) document the ROS installation
3) create a basic cheatsheet for ROS?
4) maybe start the process of the development of the ROS integration?



October 20, 2024
A bit delayed but the documentation for the installation has been created. I managed to investigate and document the installation. The ROS version to be usaed is ROS FOXY.

updating the goal list for the upcoming week:
1)document the ROSfoxy installation process (Done)
2)start the integration process of julia and ros
3)start the integraation of ROS and Gazebo
4)start the new test process in for the collision test

researching how Gazzebo workswith ROS in order to progress that part.

FOund this video for that before class:

Appart fromthis the team met up and refactored to see what to work.


here are a few things to update teh way to work moving forward:

I need to understand how both the simulators work wiht this I started work on a shell scrypt to run both simulators. 
instead of rnning it in ros if we run it in shell scryot we can get teh same deal for it.

October 23, 2024

Okay the code shell for the shell scrypt is done I need to try to get it running 9.14pm will keep updating on it.
