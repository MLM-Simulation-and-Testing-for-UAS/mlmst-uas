Small summary on sprint 1
Team and github repository was created. The applications to be used
where downloadded in to the devices. THis includes linux, julia, gazebo, and ardupilot.
 
Tested that the installed apps work properly. I created a small Julia "Cheatsheet" the type you would use to remember or have examples of how to code basics things in a programmihng language in order to be able to reference it for quicker coding pace.
Julia seems to be a rahter big amalgam of coding languages?, You can cross reference syntax similar to java and c in all the areas.

Started sprint 2 met with the team. Started the Julia installation document.

October 2, 2024     
Finished julia installing file. Most of the information for it is on the julia website making it easy to access the document. I checked out the new UAW-Testing github repository in order to be able to familiarize myself with the files a bit morel. It will take a bit more time in order to fullly dive into it.

A bit of weird news? Sprint 2:
hurricane hit and classes got cancelled from OCtober 8th to the 18th. I lost power at the apartment making it rather difficult to work over the week.
